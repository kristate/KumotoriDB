KumotoriDB (雲取DB in Japanese) is a distibuted datastore management system that is currently developed at BlueBridge k.k. in Tokyo.

The name comes from Tokyo's tallest mountain, Kumotori-yama. The chinese characters literally mean to "take from the clouds."

This is the open source version of the project. Unfortunately due to the tight integration with BlueBridge's cluster-based system,
we are working on bringing as much of the source open as possible. No timeframe is available at this time.

KumotoriDB currently powers the following websites:
